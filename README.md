MINOR PROJECT and MAJOR PROJECT:
MINOR :Developed using machine learning can be used to detect whether a person is suffering from a cardiovascular disease by considering certain
attributes like chest pain, cholesterol level, age of the person and some other attributes.
MAJOR :Developed a AI system to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. In fact, the problem is reverse engineering of face detection where
the face is detected using different machine learning algorithms for the purpose of security, authentication and surveillance.
